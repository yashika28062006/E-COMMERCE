# Ecommerce-Follow-Along

*Milestone 1: Project Overview*

This project is designed to enhance the shopping experience by providing users with an efficient and personalized e-commerce platform. It allows users to browse, purchase, and manage products seamlessly while enjoying a user-friendly interface.

*Key Features*  

- This application uses *MERN Stack*
- *REST API Creation*: It is a style used for building web services that allow communication between a client and a server using standard HTTP methods.
- *Authentication*: This is the process of verifying the identity of a user before allowing them access to specific resources. 
- *Backend Development*: In MongoDB, schema design is the process of defining the structure and relationships of the data stored in the database.

*Tech Stack*  

- *Frontend*: React framework for building the user interface.  
- *Backend*: Node.js to handle server-side operations and APIs.  
- *Database*: MongoDB for storing user and product data efficiently.  


*Milestone 2: Project Setup and Login Page*

This milestone focuses on setting up the project structure and implementing a basic login page.

*Key Features*

- Project Setup: Initialized the project with the required dependencies and folder structure.
- Login Page: A simple login page with fields for username and password.

*Tech Stack Used*

- Frontend: React, Tailwindcss

*Milestone 3: Serevr setup and error handling.*


*Key Features:* 

Organized backend code with a clear folder structure.

Configured a Node.js server using Express to handle APIs.

Integrated MongoDB for data storage and management.

Implemented basic error handling for smooth server operations.

*Tech Stack* 

Backend: Node.js, Express  
Database: MongoDB, Mongoose


*Milestone 4: Creating User Model and Controller*

This project is a simple User Management System that allows the creation, retrieval, and management of user data. It also supports file uploads (like profile pictures) using **Multer**.

*Features*
- **User Model**: Blueprint for storing user data in the database.
- **User Controller**: Manages operations like adding, retrieving, and updating user information.
- **File Uploads**: Accepts and stores user-uploaded files (e.g., profile images).
- **Documentation**: Well-documented code for ease of 

**Milestone 5: Upload and Download User Information from Files**

This milestone focuses on implementing the ability to upload and download user information using files.

**Key Features:**

- **File Upload:** Implemented functionality to allow users to upload their information via files.
- **File Download:** Users can download their stored information in a structured format.
- **Security Considerations:** Ensured secure file handling to prevent vulnerabilities.

**Tech Stack:**

- **Backend:** Node.js, Express
- **Database:** MongoDB, Mongoose
- **File Handling:** Multer

**Milestone 6: Secure User Signup with Password Encryption**

In this milestone, we created a backend endpoint for the Signup page to securely store user data. The password is encrypted before being stored in the database to enhance security.

**Key Features:**

- **Password Encryption:** Used `bcrypt` to hash the user's password before saving it in the database.
- **User Data Storage:** Stored complete user details securely while keeping the password protected.
- **Security Compliance:** Followed best practices for data protection and compliance with security standards.

**Implementation Steps:**

1. Installed and configured `bcrypt` for password hashing.
2. Updated the user model to store hashed passwords instead of plain text.
3. Created a signup API endpoint that encrypts passwords before storing user data in MongoDB.
4. Implemented error handling and validation for user registration.

**Tech Stack:**

- **Backend:** Node.js, Express
- **Database:** MongoDB, Mongoose
- **Security:** Bcrypt for password hashing

**Next Steps:**
In the upcoming milestone, we will build more advanced features for the application, enhancing user experience and security measures.
