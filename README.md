**Milestone 6: Secure User Signup with Password Encryption**

In this milestone, we created a backend endpoint for the Signup page to securely store user data. The password is encrypted before being stored in the database to enhance security.

**Key Features:**

- **Password Encryption:** Used `bcrypt` to hash the user's password before saving it in the database.
- **User Data Storage:** Stored complete user details securely while keeping the password protected.
- **Security Compliance:** Followed best practices for data protection and compliance with security standards.

**Implementation Steps:**

1. Installed and configured `bcrypt` for password hashing.
2. Updated the user model to store hashed passwords instead of plain text.
3. Created a signup API endpoint that encrypts passwords before storing user data in MongoDB.
4. Implemented error handling and validation for user registration.

**Tech Stack:**

- **Backend:** Node.js, Express
- **Database:** MongoDB, Mongoose
- **Security:** Bcrypt for password hashing

**Next Steps:**
In the upcoming milestone, we will build more advanced features for the application, enhancing user experience and security measures.

**Milestone 7: create a backend endpoint for user login.**


**Milestone 8: create a frontend card component for products and design a homepage to display these cards for each product.**

**Milestone 9: creating a product form.**


**Milestone 10: we will create a mongoose schema for products and create and endpoint to store the product details.**
Â 
**Milestone 11:  will make our home page that will display all the products dynamic.**

**Milestone 12:we will make our My products page that will display all the products That i was added according to my mail.**

## Milestone 13:
Created a backend endpoint in Express to delete a product by its ID from MongoDB.
Used MongoDBâ€™s findByIdAndDelete() method to remove the product.
Updated the frontend UI by adding a Delete button to each product card.
When the button is clicked, it sends a DELETE request to the backend with the product ID.
Ensured that the product disappears from the UI after successful deletion.
Tested the API using Postman or an API client.
Committed the changes to GitHub and updated the README with Milestone 14 progress.
Submitted the repository link as required.

## Milestone 14:
Created a backend endpoint in Express to update a product by its ID in MongoDB.
Used MongoDBâ€™s findByIdAndUpdate() method to modify the product details.
Added an Edit button to each product card in the frontend UI.
When the button is clicked, the existing product details are auto-filled into a form.
Allowed users to modify and save the updated details.
Sent a PUT request to update the product in the database.
Ensured the updated product details appear in the UI after a successful update.
Committed all changes to GitHub and updated the README with Milestone 13 progress.

Milestone 18: Creating an end point for cart page
In this milestone, we implemented a backend endpoint to fetch all the products inside a user's cart. This functionality is essential for displaying the cart contents on the cart page.
Backend: API Integration Created a new API endpoint to fetch all products in a user's cart. Implemented server-side logic to retrieve the cart contents from the database. Frontend: Cart Page Designed a new Cart Page component that displays the products in the user's cart. Used React Router to navigate to the Cart Page. State Management and API Integration Fetched the cart contents from the backend using the API endpoint. The final product will have the following features: A user can view all products on the homepage. A user can view product details on a dedicated product info page. A user can add products to their cart. A user can view their cart contents on the cart page.
